/**
 * Game interface
 * <p>
 * The game has a map and a current {@link IActor} (the player or non-player
 * whose turn it currently is). The game also knows the current location of the
 * actor. Most methods that deal with the map will use this current location â€“
 * they are meant to be used by the current actor for exploring or interacting
 * with its surroundings.
 * <p>
 * In other words, you should avoid calling most of these methods if you're not
 * the current actor. You know you're the current actor when you're inside your
 * {@link IPlayer#keyPressed()} or {@link INonPlayer#doTurn()} method.
